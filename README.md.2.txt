RESULTS:
The performance of the linear regression model is evaluated using the mean squared error(MSE) metric.The MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.A lower MSE indicates better model performance.The MSE is calculated on the test set,and its value is printed.You would interpret the result by considering the scale of your target variable.If the MSE is low,it suggests that the models predictions closely align with the actual values.
Additinally,insights from the predictions could involve examining individual predictions,residual plots,or relevant analyses to understand where the model performs well or struggles.You may want to explore feature importance to identify which features contribute the most to predictions.
MSE provides a general idea of model performance,its crucial to consider domain-specific metrices or insights to ensure the model meets the desired criteria for success.

FUTURE WORK:
1.Advanced models:Experiment with more sophisticated regression models,such as ridge regression or lasso regression,to see if they provide better predictive performance compared to the simple linear regression model.
2.Feature Engineering:Consider creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the model's performance.This could involve interactions between variables,polynomial features,or other transformations.
3.Cross validation:Implement cross-validation to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data and ensure its stability and reliability.
