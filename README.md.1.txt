PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The purpose of project is to build a linear regression model.It is a data analysis technique that predicts the value of unknown data by using another related and known data value.Generally in the view of machine learning,linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relation between a dependent variable and one or more independent variable
     For example-:lets say we want to find the relationship between a students study hours and their test scores.here test score is dependent variable and study hours is independent variable.we collect data from group of students,where we can record study hours and corresponding test scores.
                   
                 then the equation is _test score=intercept+slope*study hours
           
     The intercept value of dependent variable when the independent variable is zero,and the slope is change in dependent variable for a unit-increase in independent variable.After doing linear regression on our data,we might find the equation i.e
                    test score=60+5*study hours
     The above equation states that every additional hour of studying,a students test score is expected to increase 5 points.Intercept 60 indicates that student who doesnot study at all is expected to score 60 on the test.
DATASET INFORMATION:
I applied preprocessing steps to prepare the data.The preprocessing steps for the dataset involved handling missing values,scaling numerical features,and encoding categorical variables.
1.Handling missing values:It involves dealing with any data points that are missing or incomplete.This can be done by either filling in the missing values with an appropriate estimate,such as the mean or median,or by removing the rows or columns with missing values.The choice of method depends on the nature of the data and the analysis being performed.The goal is to ensure that the dataset is complete and ready for analysis.
2.Scaling numerical features:It is an important step in machine learning.It helps to bring all numerical variables to similar scale,so that they have equal importance in the analysis.Common scaling techniques include standardziation subracts the mean and divides by step deviation,while normalization scales values to a specific range.Scaling numerical features improves the performance of machine learning modelsby making the features more comparable.
3.Encoding categoriccal variables:It is a way to represent categorical data,such as text or categories,as numerical values that machine learning algorithms can understand.This is necessary because most machine learning algorithms only work with numerical data.There are different techniques for encoding categorical variables,such as one-hot encodind and label encoding.One-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category,while label coding assigns a unique numerical label to each category.The choice depends on the specific dataset and nature of categorical variables.

CODE EXPLANATION:
This python code performs linear regression on a dataset using scikit-learn.Here is a breakdown of the key steps:
1.Import Libraries:Necessary libraries such as pandas,numpy,scikit-learn modules for linear regression,train-test spilit,and model evaluation,as well as joblib for solving the model,are imported.
2.Load Dataset:The dataset is loaded using pandas from a CSV file('your_dataset.csv').Replace 'your-dataset.csv'with the actual filepath.
3.Data Preprocessing:missing values are filled with the mean of each column using 'fillna',categorical variables are one-hot encoded using 'get_dummies'.
4.Split Dataset:Features (X) and the target variable (Y) are seperated.Adjustin 'target_variable_column_name' accordingly,The dataset is split into training and testing sets using 'train_test_split'.
5.Create and train linear regression model:An instance of the linear regression model is created,The model is trained using the training data('X_train' and 'Y_train').
6.Evaluate model:the trained model is used to predict the target variable on the testset('X_test'),mean squared error(MSE) is calculated using'mean_squared_error' to evaluate the model performance.
7.Save model:the trained model is saved using 'joblib.dump'for future predictions.
